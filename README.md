MLB Transaction Tracings
by M.J. Brechner

This site highlights recent transactions in Major League Baseball, making use of the MLB Data API available at https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/. All of the data received from these API endpoints is the property of MLB/MLB Advanced Media. It is used here strictly in an individual, non-commercial manner in accordance with the terms of use found at http://gdx.mlb.com/components/copyright.txt.

This project will include the following features:

1. Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app. (examples: index.js, starting at line 15, also line 47. Also see date.js, line 9)

2. Analyze data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps and display information about it in your app.
(examples: Much of the data in those arrays from feature #1, especially the JSON file in index.js starting at line 15, is analyzed with a lot of various data points drawn out)

3. Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
(examples: index.js, lines 43-59 get date information and print a number based on a combination of date and how many transactions are on the list. Also all of date.js could be relevant to this feature.)

4. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
(example: the whole site is based on the MLB API, seen starting at line 15 of index.js)
